# Competition Events Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Competition Events feature has been fully implemented to allow hierarchical organization of competitions. Events serve as parent containers (like "Neural Night") that can hold multiple imported Kaggle competitions.

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### Models (`backend/apps/competitions/models.py`)
- **CompetitionEvent**: Parent model with fields:
  - `title` (CharField) - Event name
  - `slug` (SlugField) - URL-friendly identifier
  - `description` (TextField) - Event description
  - `banner_image` (URLField) - Event banner
  - `start_date`, `end_date` (DateTimeField) - Event duration
  - `status` (CharField) - upcoming/active/ended
  - `organizer` (CharField) - Event organizer name
  - `total_prize_pool` (CharField) - Combined prizes
  - `is_featured` (BooleanField) - Featured flag
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (DateTimeField) - Timestamps

- **Competition**: Updated with:
  - `event` (ForeignKey to CompetitionEvent) - Parent event relationship

#### API Endpoints (`backend/apps/competitions/views.py`)

**CompetitionEventViewSet**:
- `GET /api/competitions/events/` - List all events
- `POST /api/competitions/events/` - Create new event
- `GET /api/competitions/events/{slug}/` - Event detail
- `PUT /api/competitions/events/{slug}/` - Update event
- `DELETE /api/competitions/events/{slug}/` - Delete event
- `GET /api/competitions/events/featured/` - List featured events
- `GET /api/competitions/events/{slug}/competitions/` - List competitions in event

**Competition Import**:
- `POST /api/competitions/import-from-kaggle/` 
  - Parameters: `kaggle_id`, `event_id` (optional)
  - Automatically assigns imported competition to specified event

#### Serializers (`backend/apps/competitions/serializers.py`)
- `CompetitionEventSerializer` - Full event data
- `CompetitionEventListSerializer` - Event list view
- `CompetitionEventDetailSerializer` - Event detail with nested competitions
- Updated `CompetitionSerializer` to include `event_title`

### Frontend Components

#### Pages

**EventsPage** (`frontend/src/pages/EventsPage.jsx`)
- Grid display of all events
- Create new event modal with form fields:
  - Title, Description
  - Start Date, End Date
  - Organizer, Prize Pool
  - Banner Image URL
  - Featured checkbox
- Status badges (upcoming/active/ended)
- Navigation to event detail pages
- Empty state for no events

**EventDetail** (`frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.jsx`)
- Full event information display
- Large banner image
- Event metadata grid (organizer, prize, dates, competition count)
- List of competitions in the event (using CompetitionCard)
- Inline Kaggle search and import functionality
- Import competitions directly into current event
- Empty state with call-to-action to import first competition

#### Styling
- `EventsPage.css` - Events grid, cards, modal forms, responsive design
- `EventDetail.css` - Banner layout, info grid, Kaggle search UI, competition grid

#### API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
```javascript
competitionEventsAPI: {
  getAll: () => GET /api/competitions/events/
  getById: (slug) => GET /api/competitions/events/{slug}/
  getFeatured: () => GET /api/competitions/events/featured/
  getCompetitions: (slug) => GET /api/competitions/events/{slug}/competitions/
  create: (data) => POST /api/competitions/events/
  update: (slug, data) => PUT /api/competitions/events/{slug}/
  delete: (slug) => DELETE /api/competitions/events/{slug}/
}

importFromKaggle: (kaggleId, eventId = null)
```

#### Routing (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- `/events` - EventsPage component
- `/events/:slug` - EventDetail component

#### Navigation (`frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`)
- Added "Events" link in navigation bar
